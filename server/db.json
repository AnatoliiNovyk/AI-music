Feel the surge! Feel the power!\n\n(Breakdown / Instrumental - Heavy, complex neurofunk drop with minimal, processed vocal ad-libs like \"Drop... drop... system shock... modulate... oscillate...\")\n(No main lyrics, just rhythmic vocalizations or short, sharp phrases over the instrumental chaos)\nOh-oh-oh...\nYeah!\nFeel the bass...\n(Synth squelches, bass rumbles, drums hit hard)\nBreak it down!\n(More intricate, percussive elements, a sense of controlled chaos)\n\n(Chorus - Returns with even more power and conviction)\nNeurofunk Pop, yeah, it's the only way\nTo rewire my soul at the close of the day\nLiquid metal basslines, a glitch in the code\nMelody takes flight, lighten the load\nFrom the squelch and the grind to a shimmering high\nUnderneath the chaos, we learn how to fly\nNeurofunk Pop, feel the future collide\nWith a rhythm in my heart, nowhere to hide!\n\n(Outro - Bassline and drums slowly fade, synth arpeggios become more distant, leaving a lingering, ethereal melody)\nNowhere to hide...\nJust the rhythm... inside...\nNeurofunk Pop... yeah...\nFading out... but the feeling remains...\n(Last synth note hangs, then dissolves into silence)",

    "lyrics": "(Intro - Synth arpeggios build slowly, with a steady, pulsing beat underneath. Atmospheric, slightly dark.)\n\n(Verse 1)\nSunrise bleeds across the pane, a whisper in the static rain\nAnother day, the same old drone, but something's stirring in my bones\nA low hum starts beneath the floor, knocking on a secret door\nWaiting for the frequency to set my spirit wild and free\n\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThe beat begins to find its place, a spark ignited in this space\nNo holding back, no soft decline, preparing for the grand design\nOh-oh-oh, feel it rise!\nOh-oh-oh, behind my eyes!\n\n(Chorus)\nThis is the sound, the grand release, a synth-wave breaking all the peace\nIt's epic pop, a soaring high, beneath a vast, electric sky\nFrom quiet hum to thunder's call, we're dancing through it all\nWith every pulse, a brand new start, this epic pop, it owns my heart!\n\n(Verse 2)\nThe bassline drops, a heavy sigh, as colors bleed across my eye\nThe rhythm takes a primal hold, a story waiting to unfold\nNo gravity can keep us down, we're floating 'round this neon town\nEvery note a jolt of fire, taking us a little higher\n\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThe beat begins to find its place, a spark ignited in this space\nNo holding back, no soft decline, preparing for the grand design\nOh-oh-oh, feel it rise!\nOh-oh-oh, behind my eyes!\n\n(Chorus)\nThis is the sound, the grand release, a synth-wave breaking all the peace\nIt's epic pop, a soaring high, beneath a vast, electric sky\nFrom quiet hum to thunder's call, we're dancing through it all\nWith every pulse, a brand new start, this epic pop, it owns my heart!\n\n(Bridge - Beat might drop slightly, then build with more layers of synth and a driving rhythm)\nOh-oh-oh, feel the current flow, from the depths to the grandest glow\nOh-oh-oh, let the feeling grow, a million stars begin to show\nNo fear, no doubt, just pure desire, taking us beyond the wire\nBreak the chains, ignite the flame, screaming out its vibrant name!\n\n(Chorus - More intense, possibly with ad-libs, bigger synth swells)\nTHIS IS THE SOUND! The grand release! A synth-wave breaking all the peace! (Yeah!)\nIt's EPIC POP! A soaring high! Beneath a vast, electric sky! (So high!)\nFrom quiet hum to thunder's call, we're dancing through it all!\nWith every pulse, a brand new start, this epic pop, it owns my heart!\n\n(Outro - Beat slowly fades, synth arpeggios echo and dissolve, a final, lingering synth chord)\nIt owns my heart... yeah...\nElectric sky...\nEpic pop...\n(Beat becomes a faint pulse, then silence)",

    "title": "Все Хуйня",
    "lyrics": "Okay, this is a fantastic prompt for post-punk. The core message \"це все хуйня, те що ми робимо\" perfectly encapsulates the existential dread, cynicism, and futility often explored in the genre.\n\nHere are the lyrics, aiming for a driving, repetitive bassline, angular guitar riffs, and a detached, almost monotone vocal delivery that occasionally breaks with a frustrated edge.\n\n---\n\n**Song Title:** Сіра Хуйня (Grey Bullshit)\n\n**Genre:** Post-Punk\n\n**(Intro - 8 bars)**\n*(Driving, repetitive bassline, sharp, slightly dissonant guitar riff, sparse, mechanistic drums. No vocals.)*\n\n**(Verse 1)**\nРанок сірий, кава гірка,\n(Grey morning, bitter coffee)\nТі ж обличчя, та ж метушня.\n(Same faces, same hustle)\nКроки лунко б'ють по бруківці,\n(Footsteps echo on the pavement)\nІнший день у цій самій клітці.\n(Another day in this same cage)\nПапірці, екрани, мертві цифри,\n(Papers, screens, dead numbers)\nНаші душі – примари, привиди.\n(Our souls – phantoms, ghosts)\nМи говоримо про завтра, про вчора,\n(We talk about tomorrow, about yesterday)\nА сьогодні – це просто сіра стіна.\n(But today – it's just a grey wall)\n\n**(Chorus)**\n*(Vocals slightly more intense, almost a detached shout. Guitar becomes more rhythmic and insistent, drums hit harder.)*\n**Це все крутиться, але стоїть.**\n**(It all spins, but stands still.)**\n**Це все шумить, але мовчить.**\n**(It all makes noise, but is silent.)**\n**Ми будуємо, а воно гниє.**\n**(We build, but it rots.)**\n**Це все хуйня, те що ми робимо.**\n**(This is all bullshit, what we're doing.)**\n\n**(Verse 2)**\nМи плануємо, рахуємо, будуємо плани,\n(We plan, calculate, build plans)\nП'ємо отруту з порожніх склянок.\n(Drink poison from empty glasses)\nОбіцянки, мрії, гучні слова,\n(Promises, dreams, loud words)\nВсе розсипається, мов суха трава.\n(Everything crumbles, like dry grass)\nСистема дихає, меле і плює,\n(The system breathes, grinds, and spits)\nНаші надії повільно гниє.\n(Our hopes slowly rot)\nМи шукаємо сенс у цьому хаосі,\n(We search for meaning in this chaos)\nАле знайдемо лише відлуння голосів.\n(But only find the echo of voices)\n\n**(Chorus)**\n*(Vocals maintain intensity. Music tight and driving.)*\n**Це все крутиться, але стоїть.**\n**(It all spins, but stands still.)**\n**Це все шумить, але мовчить.**\n**(It all makes noise, but is silent.)**\n**Ми будуємо, а воно гниє.**\n**(We build, but it rots.)**\n**Це все хуйня, те що ми робимо.**\n**(This is all bullshit, what we're doing.)**\n\n**(Bridge)**\n*(Music becomes slightly sparser, bassline more prominent, guitar plays a single, repeating, unsettling note or chord. Vocals are almost spoken-word, more reflective and numb.)*\nСвітло миготить, ритм гуркоче,\n(Light flickers, rhythm rumbles)\nЩось всередині мовчки кричить.\n(Something inside silently screams)\nЦя порожнеча, вона не болить,\n(This emptiness, it doesn't hurt)\nВона просто є, і просто стоїть.\n(It just is, and just stands)\nЧи є вихід? Чи є шлях?\n(Is there an exit? Is there a way?)\nЧи це просто безкінечний холод?\n(Or is this just endless cold?)\nІ ми далі йдемо, не знаючи куди,\n(And we keep going, not knowing where)\nЗабувши, ким ми були.\n(Forgetting who we were)\n\n**(Guitar Solo / Instrumental Break - 8-12 bars)**\n*(Angular, melodic but cold guitar solo over the driving bass and drums. Not flashy, more about mood and texture. Builds slightly in intensity, then drops back down.)*\n\n**(Chorus)**\n*(Returns with full force, vocals slightly more desperate or resigned.)*\n**Це все крутиться, але стоїть.**\n**(It all spins, but stands still.)**\n**Це все шумить, але мовчить.**\n**(It all makes noise, but is silent.)**\n**Ми будуємо, а воно гниє.**\n**(We build, but it rots.)**\n**Це все хуйня, те що ми робимо.**\n**(This is all bullshit, what we're doing.)**\n\n**(Outro)**\n*(Chorus line repeated, fading out. Music gradually deconstructs. Bassline becomes more isolated, guitar plays fragments of the riff, drums slow and simplify.)*\nЦе все хуйня... так, це все хуйня...\n(This is all bullshit... yes, this is all bullshit...)\nПорожнеча, сірість, мовчання.\n(Emptiness, greyness, silence)\nКроки лунко... і згасання.\n(Footsteps echo... and fading)\n*(Last words, almost whispered or mumbled, as the music completely dies out with a final, lingering bass note or feedback.)*\nЦе все хуйня, те що ми робимо.\n(This is all bullshit, what we're doing.)\nЗнову і знову.\n(Again and again.)\n\n---",
